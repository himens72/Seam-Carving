# Seam-Carving

Image retargeting is the process of pasting the content of an image of certain size to a canvas of a different size. The goal is to take the content of Image and paste it to a canvas that is shorter along the x axis. Common methods include non-uniform scaling or cropping. However, both have their shortcomings. Non-uniform scaling may distort the proportions of the objects in the scene and cropping might remove important content. A better solution is seam-carving.

In this project, seam carving is implemented using dynamic programming and the OpenCV library.

Programming Language :  C++ with OpenCv Library
